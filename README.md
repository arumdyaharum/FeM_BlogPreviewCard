## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Transition

### What I learned

It's been a long time not code for frontend so my workflow was depending on what I've remembered and searching for documentation. I learned that I still have ability to code quickly. I code this website just for an hour. I also learned that my ability to translate design image into code is more accurate than I used to. Last but not least, I learned how to make animation hover which I added transition duration on base css and any hover properties will transform within transition duration.

### Continued development

Nothing to do here. It's just a simple website.

### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for read documentation of CSS.
